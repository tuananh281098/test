A starter template for **OpenAPI Specification** (OAS) projects.

This project breaks the [Swagger Petstore](https://petstore.swagger.io/) example from the official documentation into smaller files. It also adds handy commands to build, lint, and preview the OpenAPI document from the terminal.

Either if you want to create a new OpenAPI document from scratch or you already have it defined, you can use this template to guide the organization of your project.

## Features

* üìù Write OpenAPI definitions in different files.
* üîÄ Combine all files with [APIDevTools/swagger-cli](https://github.com/APIDevTools/swagger-cli).
* ‚úÖ Validate and lint the OpenAPI document with [stoplight/spectral](https://github.com/stoplight/spectral).
* ‚ú® Publish reference docs with  [redocly/redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) & GitHub Pages.

## Why?

When documenting APIs following the OpenAPI spec, I always ended with documents of thousands of lines, which were a nightmare to maintain.

For this reason, I explored how to split OpenAPI documents and described the process in my [blog](https://davidgarcia.dev/posts/how-to-split-open-api-spec-into-multiple-files/). The result of the research was this opinionated template to define, test, and publish modular OpenAPI projects.

By splitting a large OpenAPI spec into multiple files, your project becomes much more maintainable and the documentation journey enjoyable. In my case, I have also noticed that other developers are more willing to contribute and propose changes to the document when this is properly organized.

## Getting started

### Requirements

* Node.js 14 LTS

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dgarcia360/openapi-boilerplate.git
    ```

2. Install the project dependencies.

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Edit ```openapi.yaml``` to fit your API definition. If you are not familiar with the OpenAPI Specification, read first [Getting started with OAS](https://swagger.io/solutions/getting-started-with-oas/).

## Useful commands

The project lets you build, lint, and preview the OpenAPI document from the terminal, with the following commands:

### Build

The command bundles the spec as one ``.yaml`` file.

```
npm run build
```

The minified document is stored in ``_build/openapi.yaml``.

### Test

The command checks if the document follows the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification.

```
npm run test
```

### Preview

The command builds a docs site so that you can view the rendering on your local browser.

```
npm run preview
```

The server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8080.

The site is generated with [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc).
Here's a preview of a site generated with this command: [Swagger Petstore Reference Documentation](https://dgarcia360.github.io/openapi-boilerplate/).

## Ready-to-use workflows

The project uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for Continous Integration (CI).

On every new pull request, the OpenAPI document is linted with [spectral](https://github.com/stoplightio/spectral). If there are changes that introduce errors, the bot will highlight them replying to the pull request.

When the default branch (``master``) receives an update, a workflow automatically publishes the API reference documentation site to GitHub Pages.

See ``.github/workflows`` to customize the available workflows. If you don't plan to use GitHub to host your spec or prefer to keep docs private, delete the ``.github`` folder.
